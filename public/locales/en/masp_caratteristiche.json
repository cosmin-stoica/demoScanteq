        "desc_1": "In the context of Industry 4.0 automation, the MASP (Mounting Assisted Software Platform) is proposed, allowing the flexible and efficient implementation of control systems with advanced technological content within production lines through an effective combination of proprietary software and hardware tools.",
        "desc_2": "The operation is based on the execution in a predetermined order of a series of operations, called Jobs, which represent steps performed by the software, electronics, and electromechanics, with or without operator intervention, necessary to achieve a final result."
    },
    "characteristics": {
        "guided_conduct_title": "Guided Conduct",
        "guided_conduct_desc": "The correctness of operations is guaranteed by an intuitive user interface with automatic panels containing images and messages that guide the operator through each work step. The system is effective thanks to customizable and easy-to-implement configuration methods for images and messages. Additionally, the platform includes a panel for displaying instructions through images, PDF files, and videos, which are useful for staff training without the use of paper materials, providing all related benefits.",
        "automation_of_procedures_title": "Automation of Procedures",
        "automation_of_procedures_desc": "The standard operation of workstations involves hardware and software assisting the operator. However, operator intervention is necessary for the tasks. The MASP platform offers the possibility to automate many operations without the need for operator confirmation. These operations include analog checks, such as verifying absorbed currents or electrical resistances, and the automatic movement of mechanical parts to perform complex operations.",
        "traceability_of_results_title": "Traceability of Results",
        "traceability_of_results_desc": "During the work cycle, the system saves all relevant parameters and other essential data for traceability, such as the manufacturer's name, workstation code, date and time, username, and product codes. At the end of the cycle, the data is stored in various formats: CSV files, tables in MySQL or SQL Server databases, and sent to MES systems. It is also possible to release labels printed on thermal paper. These features ensure efficient traceability, essential for Industry 4.0 production systems.",
        "traceability_of_results_button": "See More",
        "customization_of_operations_title": "Customization of Operations",
        "customization_of_operations_desc": "The platform is designed to offer modern technology for production systems flexibly. During development, maximum attention was paid to obtaining a highly customizable environment through INI files. These simple text files contain specific fields that technical staff can easily modify to manage the configuration parameters of work cycles, such as the number of repetitions in case of failure, reference values, messages, and images to be displayed.",
        "peripheral_configuration_title": "USER BIOMETRIC AUTHENTICATION",
        "peripheral_configuration_desc": "To assign specific permissions to staff, users are divided into three categories: User, Coord, and Admin, each with a username. The machine will not start any work cycle if no user is logged in, as it would not be possible to associate the worked piece with a specific person. Login can be performed by selecting the user from a list and entering the PIN, reading the badge code using a barcode reader, or scanning the fingerprint with a certified FIPS 201 PIV and IP64 module.",
        "operator_safety_title": "Operator Safety",
        "operator_safety_desc": "During dangerous operations, it is essential for the operator to stay away from the hazardous area. The platform offers hardware and software solutions to ensure safety, such as a two-hand control positioned in a safe area to deactivate dangerous systems and an electronic mat that signals presence in prohibited areas. Other methods are managed solely by the software. For example, in a test with a moving load cell, the force is monitored to avoid overloads, stopping the operation if necessary."
